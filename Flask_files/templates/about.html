										<b>1 INTRODUCTION<br><br>
											1.1  Overview<br>
										 <p> Pneumonia is an acute inflammation of the lungs caused by infection. An estimated 4 to 5 million people in the United States develop Pneumonia each year, of whom about 55,000 dies. In the United States, Pneumonia, along with influenza, is the 8th leading cause of death and is the leading infectious cause of death. Pneumonia is the most common fatal hospital-acquired infection and the most common overall cause of death in developing countries.
										  As we know this disease is becoming a major threat which needs to be tackled. With growing technology and computational power. It becomes beneficial and also necessary to integrate artificial intelligence to make these predictions faster and more accurate.
										  Artificial intelligence enables intelligent decision making. This intelligence is not human intelligence. It’s the machine’s best approximation to human intelligence. As AI systems learn from real-time data, AI systems can refine their decision-making capabilities to improve the outcome.
										  </p>
											1.2  Purpose<br>
										  <p>The main objective of this project is to help the doctors to predict the pneumonia disease more accurately using a deep learning model. The objective is not only to help the doctors but also to the patients to verify whether they have pneumonia or not. By using this model we can precisely predict pneumonia. A convolutional neural network model is built from scratch to extract features from a given chest X-ray image and classify it to determine if a person is infected with pneumonia. a web is built where the user can upload the x-ray image and the result is shown on the UI 
										  </p>
										  2 LITERATURE SURVEY<br><br>
											2.1  Existing problem<br>
										 <p>In the current scenario, doctors manually check the patient’s X-ray image for predicting the presence of pneumonia disease. In some cases, even after the careful examination, it is still unsafe to conclude about the presence of disease. A doctor might need the reports of some other tests to conclude to a particular decision. It is very time taking process since it is a manual process and more tests are being done. It is not at all good for a patient who is suffering from the disease and reports for the disease are not yet generated in time.
										  </p>
											2.2  Proposed solution<br>
										  <p>The solution is to shift the prediction process is shifted from manual to digital.
										  The prediction is done using the CNN deep neural networks which are trained on thousands of labelled images. The predictions are faster and accurate. The doctor will upload the X-ray image into the web application (built using Flask), in which the back end is coded using python modules like Keras and tensor flow modules which will help in prediction from the pre-trained model. Within some clicks, a doctor will be knowing if the user is having pneumonia or not.
